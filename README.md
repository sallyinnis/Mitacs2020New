# Accessing Data/ code for Mitacs Interactive Maps
The link below is the link to code chunk I am working on. 

### The last map on the page is interactive and it shows the locations of the tailings storage facilities across Canada that will be used in our TSF runout analysis **(n = 134)**. 

*These TSF were filtered with the following criteria:* 
  1. Location = Canada
  2. TSF = Water retaining (ie. removal of in pit, dry stack etc...)
  3. Dam Height > 10 m 
  4. TSF in database with unreliable/no Lat/Long information were removed
The raw data was also categorized in consistent searchable terms ie. changing centerline and centreline to centerline. 

The below link will let you access the maps
the excel document is the raw data used in the maps.
